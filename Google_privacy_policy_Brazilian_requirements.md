Brazilian requirements

If Brazilian data protection law applies to the processing of your information, we provide the controls described in this policy so you can exercise your right to:

* Obtain confirmation on whether we process your information
* Request access to, update, review, anonymise, and remove your information
* Object to or restrict the processing of your information
* Export your information to another service

For users based in Brazil, the data controller responsible for your information is Google LLC, unless otherwise stated in a service-specific privacy notice. 
In other words, Google LLC is responsible for processing your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.
