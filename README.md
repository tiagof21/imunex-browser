# Imunex Browser

You should consider using Imunex Browser to: "<i>Make Chromium Great Again!</i>". Because sometimes "<i>less is more</i>". 

`Imunex Browser` was made by me. Therefore "<i>My Browser, My Rules!</i>". Fortunately, you can have your browser too and make you own rules! It's easy! Ask me how! ;)

`Imunex Browser` is a minimalist and hardened Chromium-based web browser.

`Imunex Browser` is free for personal use. It is not an open source project. 

`Imunex Browser` is not designed for developers/sysops due to it's default security concept, missing tools like Inspect/DevTools. For Developers I'd recommend using [Aloha Browser] or [Chromium Canary] or you can keep using your favorite one.

Don't expect to see any visual or exclusive feature from `Imunex Browser`, while 99% of the hardening is made under the hood. Actually, you will probably feel less trackers/ads annoying you while browsing the web and slightly more responsive when loading web pages (IMHO). You can test the browser perfomance on https://www.browserbench.org/ 

Optionally you can try one of our favorites background/themes (yet to be published).

The primary goal of `Imunex Browser` is to offer a secure and privacy-focused web browsing experience by eliminating features that, in my opinion, unnecessarily store and persist sensitive user data, however it is up to the user's choice to control - in practice, once those features are available and default enabled, user's are more likely to use. It is intentionally designed not to prompt the user to ‚Äúsave passwords‚Äù or store login credentials by disabling the built-in Password Manager and the "Offer to save password" feature.

This approach also extends to payment methods‚Äîwhich are disabled by default‚Äîsince modern cyber threats increasingly target stored credentials and financial information. These features, originally introduced to enhance convenience, have now become common attack vectors. We believe that credential management should no longer be the responsibility of a web browser. Instead, users are encouraged to adopt dedicated tools such as password vaults or credential management solutions designed specifically for secure storage.

The Google Safe Browsing feature remains enabled by default to protect users from malicious sites and phishing attacks. However, because it involves the use of hashed data, users who prioritize maximum privacy may choose to disable it via the browser's Settings page.

üè¢ Imunex Browser Enterprise
`Imunex Browser Enterprise` offers multiple levels of advanced customization, far exceeding the privacy and security capabilities of the personal edition. In addition to enforcing strict privacy controls, it introduces powerful enterprise-grade security features aligned with the latest cybersecurity standards.

Your company can customize a wide range of features, from visual aspects to trusted certificate/devices, directory integration, compliance and content analysis.

Organizations can configure over 100 policy-based controls, deploy custom branding, and create a web browsing environment tailored to their specific operational and compliance needs. This level of control represents a significant advancement in managing corporate web access and security.

As a Google Partner Advantage member, we are also able to integrate other Google Cloud solutions, providing a unified, high-assurance cybersecurity approach through Chrome Enterprise and related tools. This enhances data protection and user privacy across your company‚Äôs digital environment.

üì¶ Enterprise Deployment & Custom Services
For commercial deployments, custom branding or tailored features, you will soon be able to Request a Service through the `Imunex Browser Enterprise` GitHub repository (coming soon). Until this you can contact directly by e-mail at: browser@imunex.ai

Here are some of the core Chrome Enterprise features and customizations available to enterprise customers.

For the Enterprise version all features can be managed, the features listed as ‚ùå does not means that it is not available, instead, it means that I do not recommend for a Enterprise web browser to have those features enabled. Depending on the companies needs, those features maybe make sense.

## Contributing

These are very small changes in the source code of Chromium and this is the main reason that (for a while) the `Imunex Browser` will not be available at any Application Store. 
`Imunex Browser` does not have scheduled updates or upgrades or any kind of technical support for the personal use version, however changes and/or proprietary features can be released without annoucement.
If you want to share ideas, request features or request a feature removal let us know.

## Sponsors & Donation

`Imunex Browser` is sponsored by Rezolvnet Solu√ß√µes em Inform√°tica Ltda.

## MISC
> `As any binary file the releases of Imunex Browser are not reproducible. Binary installers inherently embed build‚Äêspecific metadata‚Äîtimestamps, compiler and linker 
> paths, file‚Äêorder in archives, compression headers, GUIDs, and code‚Äêsigning signatures‚Äîthat vary with each build environment or invocation. Because these values differ > even when the source is identical, the resulting installer binaries cannot be reproduced bit-for-bit.`

## Motivation and Future work
`Imunex Browser` was motivated by a series of well-known and unknown web browser's, but this is a looong story. 
I am working on a new Imunex proprietary feature for `Imunex Browser Enterprise` for macOS.


# ![Logo](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/chrome/app/theme/chromium/product_logo_64.png) About Chromium

Chromium is an open-source browser project that aims to build a safer, faster,
and more stable way for all users to experience the web.

The project's web site is https://www.chromium.org.

To check out the source code locally, don't use `git clone`! Instead,
follow the instructions on [how to get the code] (<a href="https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/docs/get_the_code.md">docs/get_the_code.md</a>).

Documentation in the source is rooted in (https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/docs/README.md)(docs/README.md).

Learn how to [Get Around the Chromium Source Code Directory
Structure] (https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/getting-around-the-chrome-source-code).

For historical reasons, there are some small top level directories. Now the
guidance is that new top level directories are for product (e.g. Chrome,
Android WebView, Ash). Even if these products have multiple executables, the
code should be in subdirectories of the product.
